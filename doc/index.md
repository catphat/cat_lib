# Overview

**Catlib** is a collection of useful C/C++ data structures and utilities maintained by [catphat](https://github.com/catphat).
Due to being relatively new to C++, I am using [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) as a reference, which from my naive perspective
seems to be a quality project.




## Catlib API

**API is extremely unstable.** I'll incorporate a main and dev branch once the design of the API has settled.
